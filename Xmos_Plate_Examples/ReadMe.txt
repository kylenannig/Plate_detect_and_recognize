License plates collected by Steven Anzivino

The image type is either .jpg or .png

Method of Collection:

Just Plates:
Searching around on google for images of just plates (centered).
Avoided any license plate labeled "product" by google
"Sample" license plates are avoided, Ex: ABC-123
Banned license plates are not, Ex: FARTBUS


Full Vehicle:
Searching car based subreddits for pictures of cars with licence plates.
 Please forgive the r/shittycarmods, but im sure it will prove a challenge for the algorithm
FacingCamera: images of cars with a licence plate facing the camera (+/- ~10*)
Angled: images of cars with a licence plate at difficult angles (10*-60*)
Challenge: images of license plates that are partially obscured or low quality
  These images should probably be considered testing images, they may confuse the training process.

Metadata:
Currently (9-29) images are sorted into the groups defined in the method of collection.
The image is of only one vehicle and the name of the image is the license plate (as I read it)
